# Python-Samples

This sample Python code is being created as a self learning project.

Any files named Learn_ were created based on other people's tutorials. The code is largely a replication of other people's creations. The goal is to quickly sample multiple libraries within Python.

All other files were created as strictly my own project as a way to apply the material learned in the tutorials. The initial files that I am creating are meant primarily to gain more familiarity with the functionality of libraries in Python. Eventually, I may do a full blown project.
